# Coursera "Getting and Cleaning data": Course project
## - Create a tidy data table showing means and standard deviation of activity data generated using Smartphone gyroscope and accelerometer data -

## Description of the tidy data table
#### The data are from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset", compiled by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto at the Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova. See www.smartlab.ws and http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones for more information. 

### Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, and each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz were captured. The cohort was originally divided into two groups, but both groups were combined in the "tidyData.txt" table.  
### The Smartlab team originally had calculated a _total of 561 features_ from the time (denoted by "t" in the prefix) and the frequency domain (denoted by "f" in the prefix). Of those 561 features the _"tideData.txt" only contains 79 features_ which represent either mean or standard deviation of select features. See 'features_info.txt' in the data folder for more details.

### During the data collection period subjects could engage in the same activity more than once. In that case the mean of all instances of a given activity of a given subject was calculated. Therefore, "tideData.txt" contains one row per subject for one activity. The total number of rows (without the header) is 180 (6 features with 30 subjects). 

### The first 2 _columns of "tideData.txt"_  are Subject and Activity, the remaining 79 columns are features.
